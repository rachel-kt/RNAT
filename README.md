# RNA thermometers

Pathogens like bacteria use complex strategies to coordinate its gene expression in response to diverse host environment for its survival. A shift from the ambient environmental temperature to host body temperature has been reported to be an important signal for pathogenesis. Consequently, the expression of many virulent genes is thermo-regulated. A transition in the RNA conformation in response to change in temperature is one of the important mechanisms used by several pathogens.
